# Forest homologation

Harmonization of Global forest Cover datasets with National datasets

This is the base for a package to obtain forest cover maps from the Golbar forest Cover dataset by Hansen et al (2013) and run a pixelwise comparison with Colombian Forest Cover Datasets produced by the **Forests and Carbon Monitoring System - SMBYC** at the National Institute for Metereology and Environmental Studies (IDEAM).

## Objectives

1. Assess the level of agreement between both datasets using different canopy cover thresholds for GLAD forest data
2. Identify the threshold that produces the highest level of overall agreement between both datasets
3. Perform the process for ecologically homogeneous spatial units.


Scripts and the documentation of the forest armonization and assesment between the GLAD global forest maps (Hansen et al, 2013) and the forest/no forest maps produced by the SMBYC program at IDEAM (Galindo, 2014)

How is it possible that i still don't know where the Masked and unmasked rasters ares and what the last version of the code is!
\In NIMBUS:
1. path=("/storage/home/TU/tug76452/biotablero/binary/Container_tmp"). Final masked armonized masks. Need the unmasked.
