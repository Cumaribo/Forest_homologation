This is the base for a package to obtain forest cover maps from the Golbar forest Cover dataset by Hansen et al (2013) and run a pixelwise comparison with Colombian Forest Cover Datasets produced by the **Forests and Carbon Monitoring System - SMBYC** at the National Institute for Metereology and Environmental Studies (IDEAM).

## Introduction

### Background and importance 

### "lit review'

## Objectives

1. Assess the level of agreement between forest cover products by iteratively comparing multiple canopy cover for GLAD forest prodcuts with the national forest cover assesment
2. Identify the threshold that produces the highest level of overall agreement between both datasets
3. Perform the process for ecologically homogeneous spatial units.

## Specific:

Fill spatial and temporal gaps in national forest coverage reporting, but homogued to the national standards (policy)
Reduce costs and increase speed in obtaining new data.

Use local experience and datasets as validation datasets wit ha sample = population

Identify-> somehow assess over/sub register of forest coverage/forest loss in the national dataset.  

## Materials and Methods

### Study Area

Continental extent of Colombia, divided in 379 spatial units.  
### Biomes

### GLAD Forest Cover Data
### IDEAM SMBYC Forest Cover Data

Method1

Obatain Forest cover maps trheshods 20-100%  for GLAD for two different years available for GLAD (2010-2017)
Scripts and the documentation of the forest armonization and assesment between the GLAD global forest maps (Hansen et al, 2013) and the forest/no forest maps produced by the SMBYC program at IDEAM (Galindo, 2014).
Extract change maps between both dates.
Split the change maps at the *bioma* level

How is it possible that i still don't know where the Masked and unmasked rasters ares and what the last version of the code is!
\In NIMBUS:
1. path=("/storage/home/TU/tug76452/biotablero/binary/Container_tmp"). Final masked armonized masks. Need the unmasked.
